  <h1>星箱 lit. Star-box, (StarVOX)</h1>

   <blockquote> <p><i>"That thing is so shiny... it's goober starvox. You sound funny. "</i></p> </blockquote>
    <p><strong>StarVOX</strong> is a box decorated with stars on continent Goiky. it irrationally has legs and walks around, but it most just dashes around. It acts like its running from something, but we havent figured it out yet.</p>

    <h1>Trivia</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Its voice is more of a voicebox.</li>
      <li>The eye inside the box actually appears through the stars and makes twinkly noises when it moves around.</li>
      <li>It likes haikus. It actually wrote one for us;
      <blockquote>
        in the info home
        <p>there is a secret to find</p>
        <p>the sign holder knows</p>
        
      </blockquote>
      <p>We don't know what it means... or how it wrote it. it doesn't even have arms.</p>
      </li>
