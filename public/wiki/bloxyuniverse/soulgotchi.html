    <p><strong>soulgotchi.</strong> 
    <p>the form that madogotchis take if their memories are successfully extracted from a corpse. the extraction requires two people to perform. the most pure extractions are from soulgotchi extracting from the corpse of the same number of limbs. there are three types corresponding to this. these are simply four, two, and none. they are commonly nicknamed birdgotchi, goopgotchi, and ghostgotchi respectively. </p>
    <p> they reside in the underside. we haven't been able to contact this place yet. the only evidence of its existence is rumors detailing similar sighting of soulgotchi just sinking into the ground. </p>

    <h1>Trivia</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>It's rumored that they sing a song during extraction. we are unsure if this is required for extraction, as there have been no recordings of one taking place.</li>
      <li>after extraction a orb representing the corpse is left behind. these are very fragile and will shatter and disappear at any disturbance.</li>
      <li>There might be a way to summon them without killing a madogotchi. we think the song is involved in this.</li>
