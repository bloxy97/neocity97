    <p><strong>Astral</strong> is a mushroom person, a biological wonder, as they effectively are mushrooms that can walk and talk, but have no relations to mushrooms in the slightest. He's taken over a forest called "The Starlit Forest" all for himself (and his 20,000 children). Usually just known as "that annoying guy from the forest."</p>
