    <p>Hey!!! thanks for coming! just some notes before you dive into my site:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>This site only looks good on firefox. Please use firefox. Google Chrome consumes this site.</li>
        <li>While the site is mostly family friendly, there is some dirty jokes so i would say if you're under 13 to please leave. You haven't reached a high enough level yet!</li>
        <li>The website <i>"functions"</i> on mobile but some parts of the site (like the wiki) are much worse on mobile.</li>
        <li>lot's of iframes on this site. just a head's up.</li>
        <li>That should be it! if you're ready, poke the green orb.</li>
      </ul>
